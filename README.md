# CipherBox

**CipherBox** is an application designed to encrypt and decrypt text in a straightforward manner. It allows users to enter text into a specific field, where they can easily encrypt it. Additionally, it provides the ability to copy the encrypted text and paste it back to decrypt it. It is useful for anyone needing to protect the privacy of their text through encryption and then retrieve it through the reverse decryption process.
